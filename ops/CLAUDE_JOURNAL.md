# Claude Code Router Integration - Work Journal

## 2025-01-28 - Initial Integration
**Branch:** feature/claude-code-router-integration  
**Commit:** e9c8634 - feat: add claude-code-router integration with security controls

### Work Performed:
1. **Configuration Setup**
   - Created `.claude-code-router/config.json` with strict security controls
   - Configured anthropic-only provider allowlist
   - Set localhost-only binding (127.0.0.1:3001)
   - Restricted models to claude-3.7-sonnet and claude-3.7-haiku

2. **Installation Scripts**
   - Built `scripts/router-install.js` with cross-platform support
   - Implemented automatic dependency installation
   - Added error handling and validation
   - Integrated with npm scripts for easy execution

3. **Security Verification**
   - Created `scripts/router-verify.js` for security compliance
   - Added banned provider detection (openrouter, iflow, etc.)
   - Implemented configuration validation
   - Added environment variable security checks

4. **Package Management**
   - Added claude-code-router and @musistudio/claude-code-router dependencies
   - Created npm scripts: router:install, router:verify, router:code, router:ui
   - Updated package.json with proper versioning

5. **Documentation**
   - Wrote comprehensive documentation in docu/docs/components/claude-code-router.md
   - Documented security features and limitations
   - Added usage examples and troubleshooting

6. **Testing Completed**
   - ✅ Router installation tested successfully
   - ✅ Security verification validated 
   - ✅ Configuration files properly created
   - ✅ All security controls working

### Commands Executed:
```bash
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add .claude-code-router/
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add scripts/router-*.js
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add package.json package-lock.json
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add docu/docs/components/claude-code-router.md
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec commit -m "feat: add claude-code-router integration with security controls"
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec push origin feature/claude-code-router-integration

# Testing commands:
node scripts/router-install.js  # ✅ SUCCESS
node scripts/router-verify.js   # ✅ SUCCESS  
```

### Rationale:
- Security-first approach to prevent unauthorized AI provider usage
- Localhost-only binding to prevent external access
- Comprehensive verification to catch misconfigurations
- Cross-platform compatibility for Windows/Unix environments
