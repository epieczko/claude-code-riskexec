# Claude Code Router Integration - Work Journal

## 2025-09-09 - Security Hardening and Documentation Cleanup
**Branch:** feature/router-security-hardening  
**Commit:** TBD - fix: harden router verification and cleanup documentation

### Issues Addressed (from code review feedback):
1. **Hardened verification script** (`scripts/router-verify.js`):
   - Added comprehensive shape validation for config JSON
   - Enhanced error messages with specific exit codes (10-33)
   - Added transformer validation (must be exactly ["anthropic"])
   - Improved route validation with format checking
   - Added malformed JSON error handling

2. **Fixed package.json**:
   - Changed test script from "No tests specified" to `npm run router:verify`
   - Removed unused `claude-code-router` dependency (keeping only `@musistudio/claude-code-router`)

3. **Documentation accuracy fixes** (`docu/docs/components/claude-code-router.md`):
   - Removed overselling of "load balancing" (we only have 1 provider)
   - Removed "intelligent routing" claims (it's static configuration)
   - Changed "encrypted communication" to "HTTPS connection to Anthropic API"
   - Added prominent warning about never committing `~/.claude-code-router/config.json`

4. **Added CI verification** (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`):
   - Runs `router:verify` and `policy:models` on all PRs
   - Prevents bad configs from reaching main branch
   - Uses dummy env vars for verification-only testing

5. **Improved ADR-001**:
   - Removed self-congratulatory "✅ Tested and Validated" language
   - Added concrete implementation details with exit codes
   - Linked to actual verification command
   - Made consequences more specific

### Commands executed:
```bash
npm run router:verify  # ✅ Enhanced validation now active
npm test              # ✅ Now runs router verification
npm run policy:models # ✅ Model policy check passes
```

## 2025-01-28 - Initial Integration
**Branch:** feature/claude-code-router-integration  
**Commit:** e9c8634 - feat: add claude-code-router integration with security controls

### Work Performed:
1. **Configuration Setup**
   - Created `.claude-code-router/config.json` with strict security controls
   - Configured anthropic-only provider allowlist
   - Set localhost-only binding (127.0.0.1:3001)
   - Restricted models to claude-3.7-sonnet and claude-3.7-haiku

2. **Installation Scripts**
   - Built `scripts/router-install.js` with cross-platform support
   - Implemented automatic dependency installation
   - Added error handling and validation
   - Integrated with npm scripts for easy execution

3. **Security Verification**
   - Created `scripts/router-verify.js` for security compliance
   - Added banned provider detection (openrouter, iflow, etc.)
   - Implemented configuration validation
   - Added environment variable security checks

4. **Package Management**
   - Added claude-code-router and @musistudio/claude-code-router dependencies
   - Created npm scripts: router:install, router:verify, router:code, router:ui
   - Updated package.json with proper versioning

5. **Documentation**
   - Wrote comprehensive documentation in docu/docs/components/claude-code-router.md
   - Documented security features and limitations
   - Added usage examples and troubleshooting

6. **Testing Completed**
   - ✅ Router installation tested successfully
   - ✅ Security verification validated 
   - ✅ Configuration files properly created
   - ✅ All security controls working

### Commands Executed:
```bash
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add .claude-code-router/
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add scripts/router-*.js
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add package.json package-lock.json
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec add docu/docs/components/claude-code-router.md
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec commit -m "feat: add claude-code-router integration with security controls"
git -C C:\SDE\source\claude-code-riskexec push origin feature/claude-code-router-integration

# Testing commands:
node scripts/router-install.js  # ✅ SUCCESS
node scripts/router-verify.js   # ✅ SUCCESS  
```

### Rationale:
- Security-first approach to prevent unauthorized AI provider usage
- Localhost-only binding to prevent external access
- Comprehensive verification to catch misconfigurations
- Cross-platform compatibility for Windows/Unix environments

## 2025-01-28 - PR Creation and Testing Phase
**Status:** In Progress - Testing Complete

### Testing Results:
✅ **Router Installation**: Successfully created user config at ~/.claude-code-router/config.json  
✅ **Security Verification**: All security controls validated  
✅ **Configuration Validation**: Localhost-only, anthropic-only, approved models only  
✅ **Provider Allowlist**: Only anthropic provider enabled  
✅ **Model Restrictions**: Only claude-3.7-sonnet and claude-3.7-haiku allowed  
✅ **Banned Provider Detection**: Script properly validates against banned providers  

### Next Actions:
1. ✅ Commit tracking files
2. ✅ Create pull request on GitHub  
3. Address any PR feedback
4. Merge to master after approval

## 2025-09-09 - Model Policy Enforcement System
**Branch:** feature/model-policy-enforcement  
**Status:** Completed and Pushed

### Work Performed:
1. **Registry System**
   - Created `.claude/registry.json` with skill-to-model mappings
   - Configured claude-3.7-sonnet for complex agents (agent.expert, command.expert, etc.)
   - Configured claude-3.7-haiku for simple commands (lint.command, test.command)

2. **Static Policy Validation**
   - Built `scripts/model-policy-check.js` for front-matter validation
   - Validates skill declarations in all agents and commands
   - Enforces allowed model list (claude-3.7-sonnet, claude-3.7-haiku)
   - Checks registry defaults and front-matter overrides

3. **Runtime Enforcement**
   - Created `.claude/hooks/pre-tool.enforce-model.json` hook
   - Runs policy validation before every tool execution
   - Prevents execution with invalid model configurations

4. **Front Matter Updates**
   - Added model policy declarations to all agents:
     * agent-expert.md, cli-ui-designer.md, command-expert.md
     * docusaurus-expert.md, mcp-expert.md
   - Added model policy declarations to all commands:
     * lint.md, test.md
   - All files now include: skill, model, maxTokens, strict flags

5. **Package Management**
   - Added front-matter dependency for parsing
   - Created npm scripts: policy:models, policy:router, policy:all
   - Integrated with existing router verification system

### Commands Executed:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/model-policy-enforcement
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement model policy enforcement system" -m "Multi-layer enforcement with registry, validation, and runtime hooks"
git push origin feature/model-policy-enforcement
npm run policy:all  # ✅ Verified all policies pass
```

### Architecture Decision:
- Multi-layer enforcement approach (static + runtime + router)
- Skill-based model mapping for consistency
- Registry-driven defaults with front-matter overrides
- Strict mode for critical agents requiring specific models

### Testing Results:
✅ **Policy Validation**: All agents and commands pass model policy checks  
✅ **Registry Loading**: Skill-to-model mappings load correctly  
✅ **Front Matter Parsing**: All markdown files parse without errors  
✅ **Hook Integration**: Pre-tool enforcement hook executes properly  
✅ **npm Scripts**: All policy scripts execute successfully
