# Claude Code RiskExec (riskexec.com)

RiskExec turns AI code assistance into a governed workflow for shipping reliable software. Instead of leaving teams with ad-hoc prompts and untracked outputs, it aligns requirements, implementation, and oversight in one coordinated system. Spec Kit structures ideas into traceable specs, BMAD runs the Build-Measure-Analyze-Decide loop with dedicated agents, and Agent OS orchestrates execution with telemetry so every decision is auditable. Together they provide a differentiated, end-to-end solution for managing AI-driven development with confidence.

### The Power Trio

- **üß± Spec Kit** formalizes how ideas become structured requirements. It defines specs, plans, and tasks so every output has traceability and quality standards ("constitution rules").
- **‚öôÔ∏è BMAD Method** encodes the engineering lifecycle as agents: Build, Measure, Analyze, Decide. These roles act like a virtual team (Analyst ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí PM ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA) that hand off deliverables automatically.
- **üß† Agent OS** provides orchestration and memory. It runs BMAD agents, monitors telemetry, and synchronizes outputs (`.agent-os/product/`) so everything is observable and replayable.

Together they give you:

- End-to-end, agent-driven delivery from idea ‚Üí tested code.
- Audit-ready artifacts (specs, plans, tasks, tests).
- Continuous learning ‚Äî agents analyze metrics and adjust decisions automatically.

### How to Use It

```bash
# Run the complete workflow for a new feature
npx claude-code-riskexec --workflow Feature-Login
```

The system will:

1. Generate a specification (`/specify`).
2. Design the architecture (`/plan`).
3. Produce tasks (`/tasks`).
4. Implement and test (`/implement`).
5. Verify outcomes (`/verify`).

All results are stored under `.agent-os/product/Feature-Login/` with telemetry for review.

### Why It Matters

This framework turns AI development from ad-hoc prompting into a repeatable, measurable engineering process ‚Äî bridging product intent, technical execution, and compliance.

```

## üîÑ End-to-End Workflow

```
SpecKit ‚Üí BMAD ‚Üí CLI ‚Üí Agent OS ‚Üí Artifacts & Metrics
```

Run the entire pipeline with a single command when you need to orchestrate Spec Kit deliverables, BMAD phase automation, and Agent OS handoffs:

```bash
npx claude-code-riskexec --workflow Feature-X
```

The CLI drops Agent OS-ready bundles into `.agent-os/`, syncs live telemetry (artifacts, metrics, and run manifests), and pushes execution summaries back to your observability stack so downstream agents can reason over the latest context.

- Learn how the runtime contracts with Agent OS modules are wired in [docs/architecture/Agent%20OS%20Integration.md](docs/architecture/Agent%20OS%20Integration.md).

### üß≠ Spec Kit Phase Automation

Phase¬†2 of the Spec Kit workflow introduces semi-automated handoffs between `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`, and the new `/verify` QA review. This repository now ships with orchestration helpers so you can drive the entire sequence with a single script or opt-in hooks:

- `scripts/runSpecKitWorkflow.js` ‚Äî Node-based runner that executes each command in order, runs constitution-aware validators after every phase, and optionally executes your test suite between implementation tasks. Launch it with `node scripts/runSpecKitWorkflow.js <feature-name> [brief] --test-command "npm test"` and set `CLAUDE_CLI` if your Claude Code binary lives elsewhere.
- `scripts/specKitPhaseTransition.js` ‚Äî Lightweight hook target used by `.claude/hooks/post-tool.spec-kit-auto-chain.json` to chain phases automatically when `SPEC_KIT_AUTO_CHAIN=1` is present in your environment.
- `scripts/validators/*` ‚Äî Specification, plan, and task validators that enforce constitution rules (required sections, traceability tags, ambiguous language checks, etc.). These run inside the workflow script and can also be required from custom tooling.

To skip phases or rerun from a checkpoint, use `--resume=plan`, `--resume=tasks`, or `--start-task "Task label"`. Pass `--skip-qa` if you want to defer the `/verify` pass. Validation failures stop the pipeline so that artifacts can be corrected before advancing.

## üß± Architecture at a Glance

Whether you're wiring up a new workflow or contributing templates, the BMAD (Specify ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Verify) phases
drive how this repository is organized:

- **Spec Kit deliverables** live under `specs/<feature>/` and are produced sequentially by the BMAD agents. Each phase handoff is encoded in the matching command (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`, `/verify`).
- **Agent and command source** sits in `.claude/` for live usage and in `cli-tool/components/` for CLI distribution. Frontmatter now includes a `phase` label so you can immediately identify where the component fits in the lifecycle.
- **Documentation** is cataloged in [`docs/SUMMARY.md`](docs/SUMMARY.md) and split across architecture, usage, and internals sections. Start with [`docs/internals/developer-guide.md`](docs/internals/developer-guide.md) for contributor onboarding, [`docs/architecture/Context_Architecture_Overview.md`](docs/architecture/Context_Architecture_Overview.md) for a deeper dive into system design, and [`docs/architecture/Agent%20OS%20Integration.md`](docs/architecture/Agent%20OS%20Integration.md) for the full Agent OS integration walkthrough.
- **Docusaurus site content** mirrors the repository docs under `docu/docs/`, making it easy to surface the same structure on [docs.riskexec.com](https://docs.riskexec.com/).
