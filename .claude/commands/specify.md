# /specify â€” Spec Kit Phase 1

Run this command to kick off the Spec Kit workflow for a feature. It partners the **BMAD Analyst** (primary) and **BMAD PM** (support) agents to author a review-ready specification.

## Usage

```
/specify <feature-name> <brief>
```

- `feature-name` (optional): folder under `specs/` to target (defaults to `Feature-A`).
- `brief` (optional): short description or goals to seed the specification.

## Task

Draft or refine the functional specification located at `specs/<feature-name>/spec.md` in alignment with `specs/constitution.md`.

## Process

1. Activate the **bmad-analyst** agent as the lead persona.
2. Load context from the constitution plus any existing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` for the feature.
3. Collaborate with the **bmad-pm** agent to confirm user value framing and acceptance criteria coverage.
4. Identify missing information, assumptions, and risks; ask for clarification when necessary.
5. Produce a Markdown specification with the required sections and traceability cues.
6. Use the Write tool to overwrite `specs/<feature-name>/spec.md` with the latest draft (unless user prefers manual copy).
7. Summarize outstanding questions and highlight the readiness gate before advancing to `/plan`.

## Output Checklist

- Executive summary connected to product goals.
- User stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria aligned with the constitution.
- Explicit traceability notes referencing downstream planning needs.
- Open questions and approval checklist items.

Use this command only when you are ready to invest in a formal specification; the next phases depend on its quality.
