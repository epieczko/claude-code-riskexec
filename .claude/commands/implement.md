# /implement â€” Spec Kit Phase 4

Use this command to execute the approved tasks with the **BMAD Developer** as the lead persona and the **BMAD QA** agent as validation partner.

## Usage

```
/implement <feature-name> <task-id>
```

- `feature-name` (optional): folder under `specs/` (defaults to `Feature-A`).
- `task-id` (optional): reference to the checklist item currently being implemented.

## Task

Perform implementation work for the selected task while strictly adhering to the specification, plan, task list, and constitution.

## Process

1. Activate **bmad-developer** as the primary agent and keep **bmad-qa** available for validation.
2. Immediately read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and constitution excerpts so the developer has context even when the command is invoked automatically with only a task identifier.
3. Restate the task goal, success criteria, and planned validation steps before editing code. When `task-id` is provided, quote the exact checklist line and confirm its acceptance criteria coverage.
4. Execute the work incrementally, using Read/Write/Terminal tools to modify files and run tests. Pause after each major edit so automation scripts can run validation commands (e.g., unit tests) before moving on.
5. Document commands executed, test evidence collected, and files touched. Include explicit callouts for any tests run by external orchestration so QA reviews have a clear audit trail.
6. Coordinate with **bmad-qa** to confirm acceptance criteria coverage or to design follow-up tests. Update `tasks.md` to mark completion status when appropriate.
7. Summarize completion status, remaining follow-ups, and readiness for review.

## Output Checklist

- Implementation notes tied to the referenced task ID and spec requirements.
- List of files updated with rationale.
- Evidence of executed tests or manual verification steps.
- Next actions or QA follow-ups before closing the task.

Run this command iteratively for each task until the feature is complete and QA sign-off is achieved.
