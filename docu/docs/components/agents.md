# Agents ðŸ¤–

**Agents** are specialized Claude Code assistants designed to excel in particular areas of development. Each agent comes with domain-specific knowledge, optimized prompts, and focused expertise to help you tackle specific development challenges more effectively.

## What Are Agents?

Agents extend Claude Code's capabilities by providing:

- **Specialized Knowledge**: Deep expertise in specific domains (React optimization, security auditing, database design, etc.)
- **Optimized Prompts**: Pre-configured instructions that guide Claude Code's responses for better results
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of specific frameworks, tools, and best practices
- **Focused Assistance**: Targeted help for particular development tasks rather than general coding support

## How Agents Work

### Integration with Claude Code
Agents integrate seamlessly with Claude Code by:

1. **Enhanced Context**: Providing specialized context about specific domains
2. **Guided Responses**: Steering Claude Code's responses toward domain-specific best practices
3. **Tool Recommendations**: Suggesting appropriate tools and libraries for specific tasks
4. **Code Review Focus**: Offering targeted code review suggestions based on specialization

### Agent Activation
When you install templates or configure your project, relevant agents are automatically activated based on:

- **Project Type**: Framework and language detection
- **Explicit Selection**: Manual agent selection during setup
- **Configuration Files**: Presence of specific configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

## Installation & Configuration

### Individual Agent Installation (Recommended)
Install specific agents using the `--agent` parameter:

```bash
# Install specific agents directly
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent=react-performance --yes
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent=api-security-audit --yes
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent=database-optimization --yes
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent=vue-development --yes
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent=docker-expert --yes
```

### Via Template Installation
Agents are also included in complete template installations:

```bash
# React template includes performance optimization agent
npx claude-code-templates@latest --template=react --yes

# Python template includes API security agent
npx claude-code-templates@latest --template=python --yes

# Node.js template includes database optimization agent  
npx claude-code-templates@latest --template=nodejs --yes

# Legacy syntax (still supported but deprecated)
npx claude-code-templates@latest --language=javascript-typescript --framework=react
```

### Manual Agent Configuration
You can also configure agents manually by modifying your `CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown
# In your CLAUDE.md file

## Active Agents

### React Performance Optimization Agent
This project uses a specialized React performance optimization agent that focuses on:
- Component re-rendering analysis
- Memory leak detection
- Bundle size optimization
- Lazy loading implementation

When working on performance issues, this agent will:
1. Analyze component render patterns
2. Suggest memoization strategies
3. Recommend code splitting approaches
4. Identify performance bottlenecks
```

### Agent-Specific Commands
Many agents come with specialized slash commands:

```bash
# Performance analysis command (React agent)
/analyze-performance

# Security audit command (API security agent)  
/security-audit

# Query optimization command (Database agent)
/optimize-queries
```

## Working with Agents

### Best Practices

#### Agent Selection
- **Choose Relevant Agents**: Select agents that match your project's primary challenges
- **Avoid Over-Configuration**: Too many agents can create conflicting advice
- **Update Regularly**: Keep agent configurations updated as your project evolves

#### Effective Agent Usage
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear context about what you're trying to optimize or solve
- **Follow Recommendations**: Agents provide tested, domain-specific advice
- **Iterate**: Use agent feedback to improve code incrementally
- **Document Decisions**: Keep track of agent recommendations you implement

### Common Use Cases

#### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Example interaction with React Performance Agent
User: "My React app is slow when rendering large lists"

Agent Response: 
"Based on the React Performance Optimization agent, here are specific strategies:

1. Implement virtualization using react-window or react-virtualized
2. Use React.memo() for list item components
3. Optimize key props to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. Consider pagination or infinite scrolling

Let me analyze your current list component and provide specific optimizations..."
```

#### Security Review
```bash
# Example interaction with API Security Agent
User: "Review this authentication endpoint for security issues"

Agent Response:
"The API Security agent has identified several concerns:

1. Missing rate limiting on login attempts
2. Password complexity not enforced server-side
3. JWT tokens lack proper expiration handling
4. CORS configuration too permissive

Here's how to address each issue with specific code examples..."
```
