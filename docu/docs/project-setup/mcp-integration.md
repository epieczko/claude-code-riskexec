# MCP Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows you to extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities, enabling it to interact with various external tools and services. This enhances Claude Code's ability to understand and operate within your development environment.

## Extending Claude Code with MCP

MCP integration enables functionalities such as:

-   **Deep Graph MCP**: Integrates with Deep Graph to allow any Codebase Graph to be used as context, improving Claude Code's responses.
-   **IDE Integration**: Facilitates diagnostics within VS Code and execution within Jupyter notebooks.
-   **Web Search**: Allows real-time information retrieval directly through Claude Code.
-   **Database Tools**: Provides connections to various databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.
-   **Development Tools**: Enables interaction with tools like Docker, GitHub, and direct filesystem operations.
