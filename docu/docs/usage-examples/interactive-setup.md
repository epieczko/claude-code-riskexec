# Interactive Setup

This is the recommended way to start using `claude-code-templates`.

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
npx claude-code-templates
```

This will launch an interactive wizard to guide you through the project setup and template installation. For a more detailed guide, refer to the [Interactive Project Setup](/docs/project-setup/interactive-setup) documentation.
