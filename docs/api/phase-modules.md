# Phase Handlers

Automatically generated from JSDoc comments in `src/phases`.
## ImplementPhase

**Source:** `src/phases/ImplementPhase.ts`

Executes implementation tasks generated by previous phases. The phase ensures
prerequisite artifacts exist, iterates over each checklist item in `tasks.md`
(or stored task context), and records implementation notes per task under the
`implementation/` directory. Outputs are mirrored to Agent OS for review.

## PlanPhase

**Source:** `src/phases/PlanPhase.ts`

Handles the plan phase by translating an approved specification into a detailed
architecture plan. The phase requires an existing `spec.md` and optionally
considers prior `plan.md` and `tasks.md` drafts. Successful execution writes a
refreshed `plan.md`, mirrors artifacts to Agent OS, and persists derived plan
context for downstream phases.

## SpecifyPhase

**Source:** `src/phases/SpecifyPhase.ts`

Generates or updates the specification for a feature by combining any provided
brief, existing drafts, and the Spec Kit constitution. The resulting
specification is written to `spec.md`, synchronized with Agent OS, and stored
in the context repository for later phases.

## TasksPhase

**Source:** `src/phases/TasksPhase.ts`

Converts an approved plan into an actionable checklist of tasks with QA notes.
Requires both `spec.md` and `plan.md`, writes the generated checklist to
`tasks.md`, mirrors it to Agent OS, and saves derived task context for
implementation.
