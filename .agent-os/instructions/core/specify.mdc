# Spec Kit â€“ Specification Phase (Agent OS)

1. Run the Claude CLI to generate or update the feature specification:
   ```bash
   claude /specify "{{ feature }}" "{{ brief | default('') }}"
   ```
   - `{{ feature }}` is the folder name under `specs/`.
   - `{{ brief }}` is optional additional context supplied by the requester.
2. Wait for the CLI to finish and confirm `specs/{{ feature }}/spec.md` was updated.
3. Mirror the result into Agent OS storage (the Spec Kit CLI does this automatically):
   - `.agent-os/product/{{ feature }}/specs/{{ feature }}/spec.md`
4. Announce completion back to Agent OS with a short summary of notable risks or open questions so the next phase can review them.
