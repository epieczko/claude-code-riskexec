description: Transform the plan into an ordered backlog with owners and estimates.

See the [`tasks` phase in spec_kit.yml](../../workflows/spec_kit.yml#L38-L53) for orchestration context.

1. Run the mapped CLI command to produce the task list:
   ```bash
   claude /tasks "${FEATURE_NAME}"
   ```
   Capture any prioritization guidance from the coordinator through subsequent prompts.
2. Wait until `specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/tasks.md` is written and verify the file contains at least one task entry.
3. Mirror the task file to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/` so downstream phases can read it.
4. Append a JSON status line with timestamps, owner assignments, and validation notes to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/logs/tasks.jsonl`.
5. Signal completion to unlock the implementation phase.
