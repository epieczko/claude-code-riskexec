# Spec Kit â€“ Task Breakdown Phase

Create the execution-ready task list with QA notes derived from the plan and specification.

```bash
claude /tasks "{{ feature }}"
```

- Replace `{{ feature }}` with the feature identifier used under `specs/`.
- The command writes `tasks.md` in `specs/{{ feature }}/` with traceable checklist items.
