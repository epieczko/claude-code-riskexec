# Spec Kit â€“ Architecture Plan Phase (Agent OS)

1. Invoke the Claude CLI to translate the approved specification into a technical plan:
   ```bash
   claude /plan "{{ feature }}"
   ```
2. Wait for the CLI execution to complete, ensuring it reads `specs/{{ feature }}/spec.md` and writes the refreshed plan to `specs/{{ feature }}/plan.md` (plus any diagrams under `specs/{{ feature }}/architecture/`).
3. Confirm the artifacts were mirrored for Agent OS consumption:
   - `.agent-os/product/{{ feature }}/specs/{{ feature }}/plan.md`
   - `.agent-os/product/{{ feature }}/specs/{{ feature }}/architecture/`
4. Report back to Agent OS with a concise plan summary highlighting architecture decisions, risks, and next-step approvals.
