description: Build an actionable architecture plan from the approved specification.

See the [`plan` phase in spec_kit.yml](../../workflows/spec_kit.yml#L24-L37) for orchestration context.

1. Run the mapped CLI command to generate the plan artifact:
   ```bash
   claude /plan "${FEATURE_NAME}"
   ```
   Provide any additional planner context requested by the coordinator through follow-up prompts.
2. Wait for `specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/plan.md` to be created or updated before continuing.
3. Mirror the result into product storage:
   ```bash
   rsync -a "specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/plan.md" ".agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/"
   ```
4. Append a JSON status record with timestamps, command arguments, and file checksums to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/logs/plan.jsonl`.
5. Notify Agent OS that planning is complete so the task breakdown can start.
