phase: verify
command: /verify
description: Perform QA validation and document the release recommendation.

See the [`verify` phase in spec_kit.yml](../../workflows/spec_kit.yml#L70-L89) for orchestration context.

1. Run the mapped CLI command to launch the QA review:
   ```bash
   claude /verify "${FEATURE_NAME}"
   ```
   Provide any additional context the coordinator requests via interactive prompts or follow-up commands.
2. Wait until `specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/qa-report.md` is produced and confirm it contains pass/fail findings.
3. Mirror the QA report (and any attached evidence directories) to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/` for archival.
4. Append a JSON status entry with timestamps, verdict, and defect counts to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/logs/verify.jsonl`.
5. Post the final QA summary so release or remediation workflows can proceed.
