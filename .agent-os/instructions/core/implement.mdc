phase: implement
command: /execute-tasks
description: Execute the engineering tasks and capture implementation evidence.

See the [`implement` phase in spec_kit.yml](../../workflows/spec_kit.yml#L54-L69) for orchestration context.

1. Run the mapped CLI command to begin implementation:
   ```bash
   claude /implement "${FEATURE_NAME}" --plan "specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/plan.md" --tasks "specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/tasks.md"
   ```
   Include branch names or feature flags supplied by the coordinator.
2. Wait until `specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/implementation/` is populated (commits, diffs, or notes) and confirm the CLI exits cleanly.
3. Mirror the entire implementation directory into `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/specs/${FEATURE_NAME}/implementation/` using `rsync -a` so QA has access to artifacts.
4. Append a JSON status entry with timestamps, repository references, and validation hashes to `.agent-os/product/${FEATURE_NAME}/logs/implement.jsonl`.
5. Publish an implementation summary and transition control to the QA phase.
