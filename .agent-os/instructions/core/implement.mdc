# Spec Kit â€“ Implementation Phase (Agent OS)

1. Execute implementation work for each task via the Claude CLI:
   ```bash
   claude /implement "{{ feature }}" "{{ task | default('') }}"
   ```
   - Omit `{{ task }}` to iterate sequentially; provide it to resume a specific checklist entry.
2. Allow the CLI command to finish so the implementation notes are written under `specs/{{ feature }}/implementation/`.
3. Confirm Agent OS mirrors were updated:
   - `.agent-os/product/{{ feature }}/specs/{{ feature }}/implementation/`
4. Reply to Agent OS with the task status, tests executed, and any follow-up actions so downstream QA or verification phases know what changed.
