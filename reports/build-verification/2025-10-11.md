# Build Verification Report â€” 2025-10-11

## Commands

| Command | Exit Code | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | 0 | Completed with deprecation warnings and reported 9 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run typecheck` | 1 | Failed: script `typecheck` is not defined in `package.json`. |
| `npm run lint` | 1 | Failed: script `lint` is not defined in `package.json`. |
| `npm test` | 0 | All 10 Jest suites passed; console output includes expected workflow logs and one handled warning from context parsing. |
| `npm run build` | 0 | Succeeds but only echoes "Build complete"; no `dist/` directory is produced. |

## Artifacts

- Logs for each command are stored alongside this report:
  - [`npm-ci.log`](./npm-ci.log)
  - [`npm-typecheck.log`](./npm-typecheck.log)
  - [`npm-lint.log`](./npm-lint.log)
  - [`npm-test.log`](./npm-test.log)
  - [`npm-build.log`](./npm-build.log)

## Observations & Suggested Fixes

1. Define the missing `typecheck` script in `package.json` (e.g., `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"`).
2. Define the missing `lint` script (for example, `"lint": "eslint ."`) and add any required dependencies.
3. The build script currently only echoes a message and does not emit a distributable directory. If a `dist/` output is expected, implement the build step accordingly.

## Dist Directory

- `dist/` directory not found; build appears to be a placeholder.
